//June 13th ToDo's:

1. Finish working on index updating between AVL and heaps
2. Get this motherfucker compiling and running like a motherfucker...
4. find where in the world did i put #3
5. use the word FUCK extensively in various ways towards various targets (e.g. - that fucking fucker ECLIPSE is a 
        motherfucking horribly implemented fucking IDE. i never want to fucking use it ne-tothemotherfucking-ver)
        
        
        BUT NOW SERIOUSLY- too much work, too little time, let's get fuckin' through with this shit.
        
        
        
        Sincerely.
